Changelog
---------

    - (1.4.0)
        - Issue#27: Reverted the forced use of legacy recognizer in Tesseract
        - Changed error handling in mrz and evaluate_mrz scripts.
        - Added --legacy parameter to mrz and evaluate_mrz scripts to explicitly enable legacy recognizer.
    
    - (1.3.0)
        - PR#25, Issue#24: Support reading images from stream. Added dependency on ImageIO.
        - Tesseract forced to use legacy mode by default (as it seems to work better than the LSTM one).
        - Result of `read_mrz`, when not None, now also provides access to the OCR-ed text in `mrz.aux['text']`.
