Changelog
---------
    - (2.1.0)
        - PR#54: add command to only extract the candidate ROIs
          The package now provides the `extract_mrz_rois` script.
    - (2.0.0)
        - PR#50: Remove pdfminer3k, as pdfminer now supports Python 3.
          The new PDFMiner does not support Python 2 any more, however. As a consequence PassportEye now also
          requires Python3.6 or above as of this release. Hence the major version number change, otherwise
          the internals are all the same.
    - (1.4.1)
        - Issue#34: ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity)
    - (1.4.0)
        - Issue#27: Reverted the forced use of legacy recognizer in Tesseract
        - Changed error handling in mrz and evaluate_mrz scripts.
        - Added --legacy parameter to mrz and evaluate_mrz scripts to explicitly enable legacy recognizer.
    
    - (1.3.0)
        - PR#25, Issue#24: Support reading images from stream. Added dependency on ImageIO.
        - Tesseract forced to use legacy mode by default (as it seems to work better than the LSTM one).
        - Result of `read_mrz`, when not None, now also provides access to the OCR-ed text in `mrz.aux['text']`. 
    
    - (1.2.4) PR#22: Extra command line parameters for Tesseract
    - (1.2.3) Issue #21: Added correct sklearn version requirement.
    - (1.2.2) PR#18: fixed skimage warnings

        - PR#12: Validate date format and validity as an additional check on top of the check digit
        - PR#15: debugging '--psm' syntax for tesseract 4
        - PR#18: fixed skimage warnings
    - (1.2.0) Pinned PyTesseract version to >= 0.2.0

    - (1.1.2) Issue #9, PR#10: Pinned PyTesseract version to 0.1.7 (newer ones are incompatible)

        - Dataflow pipeline-based processing
        - ROI detection using morphological operations ("Boone transform")
        - ROI represented as a rotated box, extracted from contours via PCA.
        - OCR via Google Tesseract. OCR is attempted via several filters.
        - mrz command line tool.
        - evaluate_mrz command line tool
